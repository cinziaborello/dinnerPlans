# DinnerPlans
  > Full stack web application for a weekly planner that gives recipes ideas and a place to store your dinner schedule.
  > For anyone who eats.

## Summary
  > The weekday planner allows you to be very organized by choosing a meal for each night, to ensure your dinners are nutritious, and to get your grocery ahead of time.
  >
  > Next time someone asks 'What's for dinner?' the answer will be a click away, instead of 'I don't know!'.

## How to use DinnerPlans
  > To get started add a customized meal of your choice or ask for an idea. Once you have an option that you like you can save it to your board. You can go back and edit or delete a meal at any time.
